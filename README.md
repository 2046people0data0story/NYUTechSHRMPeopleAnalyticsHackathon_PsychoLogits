# NYUTechSHRMPeopleAnalyticsHackathon_PsychoLogits
The growing healthcare industry faces the looming problem of heavy employee turnover which poses threats not only to financial sustainability, but also to the quality of patient care.   During this hackathon hosted by TechSHRM, an affiliated association of Society of Human Resources Management, I was working in a team of five to apply machine learning techniques to identify medical professionals who are at risk of turnover and identify risk factors associated with employee turnover.   We have developed a predictive model based on more than more than 1,500 survey responses from New York City medical professionals. And the model will be used by the healthcare management team to understand the value alignment and expectations of current employees. With insights gained from the model, they can then revamp or even re-engineer their human capital strategies to design a more supportive culture of trust and empathy and thus improve employeeâ€™s loyalty especially healthcare professionals who are deemed critical. This will ultimately bring the quality of care received by the patients, and in the long run reduce cost associated with training and recruitment, enhance employee engagement and employer branding.  Our model outputs also provide additional evidence to verify existing management hypothesis.
